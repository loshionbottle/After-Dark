changelog from 4.1.0 onward to make translators lives a bit easier;
    
    4.1.0 adds in 1 extra line for each section under generic dialogue (12ish extra lines); you'll notice the keys go up to 15 rather than 14 now
    4.1.1 Marriage.Sam.Indoor.Night.1 was missing a space...............................
    4.1.2 "Core.Sam.Fall.EarlyHeart.4" was missing a ' at the end
    4.1.3 No change to default.json - Just moved Content Patcher version to 2.6.0
    4.1.4 Changes Marriage.Sam.Rainy.Day.3 to a PetName key rather than a Descript key; it was broken and i ain't like how descript looked there
    4.2.0 Removes "Core.Sam.GivePendant" -- Realized I didn't need this when making Alex's pack, just forgot to remove it here.
          - Also fixed typo in "Core.Sam.Birthday.8"
          - Fixed "Core.Sam.Fall.MidHeart.12" (added ' to the end)

          - Added "Core.Sam.Rain.2" and "Core.Sam.Rain.3"

    4.2.2 changed festival winter 28 to 25... why did i have it at 28??
    4.2.3 Changed manifest.json to include updated key for Shadows After Dark (ILY PIXIE) -- No change to default.json
    4.2.5 fixed .4's error; just reverted back
    4.2.6 added precondition to sam's break in event -- no change to default.json
    4.3.0: I'm so sorry translators... I changed all the dialogue keys to have "AfterDark." in front...

          - Core.S with AfterDark.Core.S
          - Extra.S with AfterDark.Extra.S
          - Marriage.S with AfterDark.Marriage.S
          - Gift.S with AfterDark.Gift.S
          - Movie.S with AfterDark.Movie.S
          - AfterDark.Festival.S with AfterDark.Festival.S
          - AfterDark.Strings.S with AfterDark.Strings.S
          - AfterDark.Strings.P with AfterDark.Strings.P
    4.3.1: I'm a dumbass, no change in default.json just forgot to change a festival line in genericdialogue.json
    4.3.2: Changed #8 to $8 in AfterDark.Core.Sam.Summer.EarlyHeart.2
          - secretly removed seb dependent from newevents.json... it opened myself up to errors due to co-dependency thing :shrug: but i'm not gonna tell nexus that...
