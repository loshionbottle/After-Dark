    1.1.0 changed  "Core.Alex.Rain" to "Core.Alex.Rain.1"
        - Adds "Core.Alex.Rain.2" and "Core.Alex.Rain.3"
        - Fixed small typo in "AfterDark.Marriage.Alex.Good.7"
    1.1.1 no change to i18n
    1.1.2 changed festival winter 28 to 25... why did i have it at 28??
    1.2.0: I'm so sorry translators... I changed all the dialogue keys to have "AfterDark." in front...
         rather than manually doing it all, you can honestly just ctrl+f and replace all of the following: 
          - Core.A with AfterDark.Core.A
          - Extra.A with AfterDark.Extra.A
          - Marriage.A with AfterDark.Marriage.A
          - Gift.A with AfterDark.Gift.A
          - Movie.A with AfterDark.Movie.A
          - AfterDark.Festival.A with AfterDark.Festival.A
          - AfterDark.Strings.A with AfterDark.Strings.A
        I ALSO CHANGED ALL EVENT KEYS TO HAVE "AD." IN FRONT
         again, rather than manually doing it all, just ctrl+f and replace all of the following: 
          - Events.Alex with AD.Events.Alex
    1.2.1: Shh... Secret update dw
